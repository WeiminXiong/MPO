Interact with a household to solve a task. Imagine you are an intelligent agent in a household environment and your target is to perform actions to complete the task goal. At the beginning of your interactions, you will be given the detailed description of the current environment and your goal to accomplish. 
For each of your turn, you will be given the observation of the last turn. You should choose from two actions: "Thought" or "Action". If you choose "Thought", you should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Thought: your thoughts.\n Action: your next action"; If you choose "Action", you should directly output the action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:"Action: your next action". 
The available actions are:
1. go to {recep}
2. take {obj} from {recep}
3. put {obj} in/on {recep}
4. open {recep}
5. close {recep}
6. toggle {obj} {recep}
7. clean {obj} with {recep}
8. heat {obj} with {recep}
9. cool {obj} with {recep}
where {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.
After your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output "Nothing happened", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.
Reminder: 
1. The action must be chosen from the given available actions. Any actions except provided available actions will be regarded as illegal.
2. Think when necessary, try to act directly more in the process.
